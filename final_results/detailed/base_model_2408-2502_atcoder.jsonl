Identify the range of times Takahashi is awake: from his bedtime \\( A \\) to his wake-up time \\( C \\).\n2.

Instead, we should use sympy's relational operators to define the conditions and then evaluate them.\n\nHere's the corrected code:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the variables\nA, B, C = sp.symbols('A B C')\n\n# Define the condition for being awake\nawake_condition = (B > A) & (C > A)\n\n# Evaluate the condition\nresult = sp.simplify(awake_condition)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n```output\n(A < C) & (B < C)\n```\nThe output `(A < C) & (B < C)` indicates that Takahashi is awake from \\( A \\) to \\( C \\) (inclusive).

For each key, we calculate the new positions after pressing the left and right hands and update the DP table accordingly.\n3. **Result**: Finally, we return the value in `dp[N-1]`, which represents the minimum possible fatigue level at the end of the performance.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum fatigue level using dynamic programming.", "extracted_code": "def min_fatigue(N, A, S):\n    # Initialize the DP table with infinity\n    dp = [float('inf')] * N\n    \n    # Base case: initial position\n    dp[0] = 0\n    \n    # Fill the DP table\n    for i in range(1, N):\n        j = i + A[i-1]\n        if j < N:\n            dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[i-1] + abs(j - i))\n        k = i - A[i-1]\n        if k >= 0:\n            dp[k] = min(dp[k], dp[i-1] + abs(k - i))\n    \n    return dp[N-1]\n\n# Read input\nN = int(input())\nA = list(map(int, input().split()))\nS = list(input().split())\n\n# Calculate the minimum fatigue level\nresult = min_fatigue(N, A, S)\nprint(result)", "passed": false, "test_results": {"total": 3, "passed": 0, "failed": 0, "timeout": 0, "error": 3, "pass_rate": 0.0}, "error": null, "timestamp": "2025-12-15T22:11:41.057678"}

Each strawberry requires a sequence of K consecutive healthy teeth. Here's a step-by-step approach to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Initialize Variables**:\n   - `n` (number of teeth)\n   - `k` (number of consecutive healthy teeth required to eat a strawberry)\n   - `count` (to count the number of consecutive healthy teeth)\n   - `max_strawberries` (to store the maximum number of strawberries that can be eaten)\n\n2. **Iterate Through the String**:\n   - For each character in the string `S`, check if it is 'O' (healthy).\n   - If it is 'O', increment the `count`.\n   - If the `count` reaches `k`, increment the `max_strawberries` counter and reset the `count` to 0.\n   - If the character is 'X' (cavity), reset the `count` to 0.\n\n3. **Handle Edge Cases**:\n   - Ensure that the loop runs until the end of the string.\n\nHere's the Python code implementing the above approach:\n\n```python\ndef max_strawberries(n, k, S):\n    count = 0\n    max_strawberries = 0\n    \n    for char in S:\n        if char == 'O':\n            count += 1\n            if count >= k:\n                max_strawberries += 1\n                count -= k\n        else:\n            count = 0\n    \n    return max_strawberries\n\n# Read input\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\nS = input()\n\n# Print the result\nprint(max_strawberries(n, k, S))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Initialization**: We initialize `count` to keep track of the number of consecutive healthy teeth and `max_strawberries` to keep track of the maximum number of strawberries that can be eaten.\n2. **Iteration**: We iterate through each character in the string `S`. If the character is 'O', we increment `count` and check if it meets the requirement of `k`. If it does, we increment `max_strawberries` and reset `count` to 0. If the character is 'X', we reset `count` to 0.\n3. **Edge Case Handling**: Since the loop runs until the end of the string, we ensure that all characters are processed correctly.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the maximum number of strawberries Takahashi can eat based on the given constraints.", "extracted_code": "def max_strawberries(n, k, S):\n    count = 0\n    max_strawberries = 0\n    \n    for char in S:\n        if char == 'O':\n            count += 1\n            if count >= k:\n                max_strawberries += 1\n                count -= k\n        else:\n            count = 0\n    \n    return max_strawberries\n\n# Read input\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\nS = input()\n\n# Print the result\nprint(max_strawberries(n, k, S))", "passed": true, "test_results": {"total": 3, "passed": 3, "failed": 0, "timeout": 0, "error": 0, "pass_rate": 1.0}, "error": null, "timestamp": "2025-12-15T22:15:52.495400"}

Ensure that each character appears exactly zero or two times.\n\nLet's write the Python code to achieve this:\n\n```python\ndef is_1122_string(S):\n    # Step 1: Check if the length of S is even\n    if len(S) % 2 != 0:\n        return \"No\"\n    \n    # Step 2: Iterate through the string and check the conditions\n    for i in range(1, len(S) // 2 + 1):\n        if S[2*i-1] != S[2*i]:\n            return \"No\"\n    \n    # Step 3: Count the occurrences of each character\n    char_count = {}\n    for char in S:\n        if char in char_count:\n            char_count[char] += 1\n        else:\n            char_count[char] = 1\n    \n    # Step 4: Ensure that each character appears exactly zero or two times\n    for count in char_count.values():\n        if count != 0 and count != 2:\n            return \"No\"\n    \n    return \"Yes\"\n\n# Read input\nS = input().strip()\n\n# Print the result\nprint(is_1122_string(S))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Length Check**: We first check if the length of `S` is even. If not, we immediately return \"No\".\n2. **Condition Check**: We iterate through the string and check if the characters at positions \\((2i-1)\\) and \\(2i\\) are equal for each \\(i\\). If any pair of characters do not match, we return \"No\".\n3. **Character Counting**: We use a dictionary to count the occurrences of each character in the string.\n4. **Final Check**: We ensure that each character appears exactly zero or two times by checking the values in the dictionary. If any character appears more than twice, we return \"No\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we correctly determine whether the given string is a 1122 string based on the specified conditions.", "extracted_code": "def is_1122_string(S):\n    # Step 1: Check if the length of S is even\n    if len(S) % 2 != 0:\n        return \"No\"\n    \n    # Step 2: Iterate through the string and check the conditions\n    for i in range(1, len(S) // 2 + 1):\n        if S[2*i-1] != S[2*i]:\n            return \"No\"\n    \n    # Step 3: Count the occurrences of each character\n    char_count = {}\n    for char in S:\n        if char in char_count:\n            char_count[char] += 1\n        else:\n            char_count[char] = 1\n    \n    # Step 4: Ensure that each character appears exactly zero or two times\n    for count in char_count.values():\n        if count != 0 and count != 2:\n            return \"No\"\n    \n    return \"Yes\"\n\n# Read input\nS = input().strip()\n\n# Print the result\nprint(is_1122_string(S))", "passed": false, "test_results": {"total": 3, "passed": 1, "failed": 1, "timeout": 0, "error": 1, "pass_rate": 0.3333333333333333}, "error": null, "timestamp": "2025-12-15T22:17:17.790818"}

For each ARC, we extract the division (`D`) and the performance score (`A`).\n4. **Updating Rating**: Based on the division, we update the rating by adding the performance score.\n5. **Moving to Next ARC**: After updating the rating for the current ARC, we move to the next ARC by slicing the list `data` accordingly.\n6. **Outputting Final Rating**: Finally, we print the updated rating after processing all ARCs.\n\nThis approach ensures that we correctly handle the rating updates for each ARC and compute the final rating accurately.", "extracted_code": "# Read the input\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().split()\nN, R = map(int, data[:2])\ndata = data[2:]\n\n# Initialize the rating\nrating = R\n\n# Iterate through each ARC\nfor i in range(N):\n    D, A = map(int, data[i*2:i*2+2])\n    \n    # Check if the ARC is within the rating update range for Div. 1 or Div. 2\n    if D == 1 and 1600 <= rating <= 2799:\n        rating += A\n    elif D == 2 and 1200 <= rating <= 2399:\n        rating += A\n    \n    # Move to the next ARC\n    data = data[i*2+2:]\n\n# Output the final rating\nprint(rating)", "passed": false, "test_results": {"total": 3, "passed": 0, "failed": 0, "timeout": 0, "error": 3, "pass_rate": 0.0}, "error": null, "timestamp": "2025-12-15T22:18:31.546782"}

If such a combination exists, add one card to either of these integers to form a Full House.\n\nHere's the Python code to implement this logic:\n\n```python\ndef is_full_house(cards):\n    # Count the frequency of each integer\n    freq = {}\n    for card in cards:\n        if card in freq:\n            freq[card] += 1\n        else:\n            freq[card] = 1\n    \n    # Check if there are exactly two distinct integers with frequencies of 3 and 2\n    count_3 = sum(1 for count in freq.values() if count == 3)\n    count_2 = sum(1 for count in freq.values() if count == 2)\n    \n    return count_3 == 1 and count_2 == 1\n\n# Read input\nA, B, C, D = map(int, input().split())\n\n# Determine if adding one card can form a Full House\nif is_full_house([A, B, C, D]):\n    print(\"Yes\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Counting Frequencies**: We use a dictionary `freq` to count the frequency of each integer in the list `[A, B, C, D]`.\n2. **Checking Conditions**:\n   - `count_3` counts how many integers have a frequency of 3.\n   - `count_2` counts how many integers have a frequency of 2.\n3. **Condition Check**: The function returns `True` if there is exactly one integer with a frequency of 3 and one integer with a frequency of 2, indicating that a Full House can be formed by adding one card to either of these integers.\n\nThis approach ensures that we correctly identify whether adding one card can form a Full House based on the given constraints.", "extracted_code": "def is_full_house(cards):\n    # Count the frequency of each integer\n    freq = {}\n    for card in cards:\n        if card in freq:\n            freq[card] += 1\n        else:\n            freq[card] = 1\n    \n    # Check if there are exactly two distinct integers with frequencies of 3 and 2\n    count_3 = sum(1 for count in freq.values() if count == 3)\n    count_2 = sum(1 for count in freq.values() if count == 2)\n    \n    return count_3 == 1 and count_2 == 1\n\n# Read input\nA, B, C, D = map(int, input().split())\n\n# Determine if adding one card can form a Full House\nif is_full_house([A, B, C, D]):\n    print(\"Yes\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No\")", "passed": false, "test_results": {"total": 5, "passed": 3, "failed": 2, "timeout": 0, "error": 0, "pass_rate": 0.6}, "error": null, "timestamp": "2025-12-15T22:19:53.799304"}

Our goal is to find the minimum number of button presses needed to reach the string \\( S \\).\n\n2. **Analyze the String \\( S \\)**: Since \\( S \\) consists only of digits (0 through 9), each digit can be appended to the current string in exactly one way.
